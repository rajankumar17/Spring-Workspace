We have an API http://localhost:8091/crudemployees/, which we can access by directly putting username/password in the login form,
but third party application cannot access the API as we do in browsers. They need an oauth2 token.

As shown in the above sequence diagram, the first step is to get authorization grant from resource owner from
URL : http://localhost:8091/oauth/authorize?client_id=clientapp&response_type=code&scope=read_profile_info
